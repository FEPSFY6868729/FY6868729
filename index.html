      <h3><b>Abstract </b></h3>
      <p>In 1916 albert einstein predicted the existence of black holes, in 1963 The term black hole was used in Life and Science News magazines 
        for the first time, The first black hole to be discovered was in 1971 by Louise Webster, Paul Murdin, and Thomas Bolton.
        for hundreds of years physicians have speculated and discussed the dark enigma we now call black holes.
        Through this article I will be exploring the life cycle of black holes. To do this I will discuss the formation of black holes, then analyse the operations of them,
        Finishing with the fate of black holes. I aim to explain the black holes processes and features throughout the article. So, let us try and understand the mystery of the densest objects in the universe.
      </p>
      <h3> the formation of black holes   </h3>
      <p>The story of a black hole starts with stars, in their core nuclear fusion fuses hydrogen atoms into helium, this leads to a great deal of energy.
        This energy is the push back against gravity, the gravity balances out with the force of the nuclear fusion if there is still fusion in the core. 
        With large stars much larger than our sun, heavier elements can be fused. these elements get heavier and heavier until they reach the iron core.
        But the fusion process for iron creates no energy, as more elements are fused into iron there is less radiation energy, this leads to the balance of the two forces being broken,
        gravity overpowers the weakening radiation energy leading to the collapse of the iron core. This leads to an implosion of the star called a super nova. 
        Depending on the size of the star, this can create a neutron star, or a black hole if the star is large enough and this marks the formation of a black hole.

      <h3>Explanation of the collapse of stars.  </h3>
      <p>As spoken about in the previous paragraph, the gravitational collapse of stars is what forms black holes, all that mass in concentrated at the centre of the black hole,
        this is what physicians call a singularity. In a paper from 1965 Roger Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture, in this paper he states that all singularities formed by the collapse of stars are hidden from view inside of black holes,
        also that light cannot escape from a black hole. No one has been able to disprove this theory, so it is believed to this day.
        The name black hole came from john wheeler, and it replaced the earlier name ‘frozen star.’ (<a href="">Stephen Hawking (2018)</a>).  </p>
